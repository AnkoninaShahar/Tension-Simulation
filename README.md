**AUTHOR . . . . . . .** Shahar Ankonina                                                                              
**DESCRIPTION. . .** Real-time physics simulation of tension forces between connected nodes

---
## About
Simulates networks of interconnected nodes with tension forces, allowing users to cut tethers and explore dynamic system behavior. Highlights real-time physics computation, vector-based forces, and interactive visualization.

---
## Features
- *Realistic Tension Forces:* Tethers apply physics-based tension to connected nodes, simulating real-world interactions.
- *Breakable Connections:* Tethers have a maximum stretch threshold and break dynamically when overloaded.
- *Interactive Environment:* Users can cut tethers to manipulate the network and observe cascading effects.
- *Gravity Simulation:* Nodes are affected by a constant downward force, contributing to natural motion and equilibrium.
- *Dynamic Visualization:* Real-time updates and rendering allow users to see changes in the system immediately.

---
## Tech Stack
- *Programming Languages:* Python
- *Libraries & Frameworks:* Pygame
- *Tools & Platforms:* Git/GitHub, VS Code

---
## Installation
Follow these steps to run the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/AnkoninaShahar/Tension-Simulation.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd Tension-Simulation

# Install dependencies (Python example)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the project
python main.py

```

---
## Usage
- After launching the simulation, users can manipulate the environment by cutting tethers or spawning new nodes.
- **Controls:** Click and hold to cut tethers the mouse hovers over
